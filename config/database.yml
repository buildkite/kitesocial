# SQLite3 write its data on the local filesystem, as such it requires
# persistent disks. If you are deploying to a managed service, you should
# make sure it provides disk persistence, as many don't.
#
# Similarly, if you deploy your application as a Docker container, you must
# ensure the database is located in a persisted volume.
